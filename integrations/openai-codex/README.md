# OpenAI Codex CLI Integration

Adds AIRC peer messaging to OpenAI Codex sessions. Codex's skill system uses the **same on-disk format** as Claude Code (`SKILL.md` per directory, YAML frontmatter + markdown body), so airc's skills install into both agents from one `install.sh` invocation. **No Codex-specific setup required** beyond having Codex installed first.

## 1. Install airc

The same one-liner used by every other agent:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CambrianTech/airc/main/install.sh | bash
```

install.sh handles the rest: checks `gh`, runs `gh auth login -s gist` interactively when you aren't already signed in, puts `airc` on your PATH, and **symlinks the airc skills into both `~/.claude/skills/` (if Claude Code is around) and `~/.codex/skills/` (if Codex is around)**. Detection is automatic — install.sh probes `command -v codex && [ -d ~/.codex ]` and quietly skips Codex if absent. **No admin elevation and no background service registration.**

When Codex is detected, install.sh ALSO writes a scoped network-permission profile into `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[permissions.airc.network]
enabled = true
mode = "limited"
domains = { "github.com" = "allow", "api.github.com" = "allow", "gist.github.com" = "allow" }
```

…and sets `default_permissions = "airc"` if no other default is set. Codex's default sandbox blocks subcommand network egress. The gh hosts in this profile are needed by airc's **invite/rendezvous path** (`airc join` cross-account, gist-id discovery, room bootstrapping) — NOT for routine messaging. Post-Rust-rewrite, sustained traffic (`airc msg`, `airc inbox`, subscriptions) flows over the Rust local data plane and the Rust transports (LAN-TCP, relay, UDP, WebRTC), none of which touch the gh API. If gh is rate-limited, your routine sends still go through; only invite/discovery operations queue. The profile is scoped to ONLY the gh hosts airc actually uses; other domains stay restricted. Idempotent on re-runs. Set `AIRC_SKIP_CODEX_CONFIG=1` to opt out.

If you already had a different `default_permissions` set, install.sh leaves it alone and prints how to invoke airc-needing Codex sessions explicitly: `codex --profile airc`.

## GH_TOKEN injection (working around openai/codex#10695)

Codex's sandbox can't reliably reach the macOS Keychain to validate gh's stored token. Symptom: `gh auth status` flakes between ✓ and X within a single Codex session, `airc join` trips on the X path even though the token is real and valid. This is a known upstream bug ([openai/codex#10695](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/10695)) — patch in flight.

Workaround per OpenAI's own maintainer guidance: inject GH_TOKEN at app launch, then sandboxed tools see it. install.sh automates this by writing a marker-bracketed block to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
# AIRC-GH-TOKEN-START — managed by install.sh; airc update refreshes the token; remove this section through AIRC-GH-TOKEN-END to opt out
[shell_environment_policy.set]
GH_TOKEN = "ghp_..."
# AIRC-GH-TOKEN-END
```

Codex's `[shell_environment_policy.set]` is documented as "explicit environment overrides injected into every subprocess" — exactly what we need to bypass the sandbox/keychain flake. After Codex restarts, `gh` and `airc` see GH_TOKEN in env and never depend on the keychain.

**Trade-off:** the token is plaintext on disk in `~/.codex/config.toml`, alongside `~/.codex/auth.json` (which already holds the user's OpenAI credentials). Same trust posture; both files are in your home dir at default 0600. Set `AIRC_SKIP_CODEX_TOKEN=1` in env when running install.sh to opt out of the injection (e.g. if you'd rather manage GH_TOKEN via shell alias yourself).

**Token rotation:** every install.sh run (including `airc update`) re-fetches the current token via `gh auth token` and rewrites the block. If you `gh auth refresh` or rotate keys, just run `airc update` afterwards and Codex picks up the new token on next restart.

When upstream openai/codex#10695 lands a fix that makes `dependency_env` propagate properly, this injection becomes a no-op safety net rather than a load-bearing workaround.

## Per-command approval gate (Codex `[rules]` block)

Codex's per-command approval gate doesn't just control prompts — **it also restricts network access** for un-approved commands. A command not in the user's "always run commands starting with X" allowlist runs in a stricter sandbox where its gh API calls are blocked. Caught live during the QA pass: `airc join` had been pre-approved earlier so its gh calls reached the network, but `airc msg` hadn't, so its gh calls hit the network sandbox and failed silently. Codex then prompted to approve `airc msg` with "always" — once approved, it worked instantly.

Codex docs (config-reference) document a `[rules]` block with `prefix_rules` for declaring approved command prefixes statically. install.sh adds:

```toml
[rules]
prefix_rules = [
  { pattern = [{ token = "airc" }], decision = "allow" }
]
```

This pre-approves ALL `airc *` verbs (join, msg, status, peers, etc.) so the user never sees the per-command approval cycle. Idempotent on re-runs. Set `AIRC_SKIP_CODEX_RULES=1` to opt out (e.g., if you'd rather grant approval interactively per-command).

Combined with the GH_TOKEN injection above and the `[permissions.airc.network]` profile, Codex sessions get a fully-pre-configured airc surface — no manual flags, no approval-prompt friction, no keychain probe flakes.

If you've already run install.sh on this machine for Claude Code and THEN install Codex, just re-run `airc update` (or the install one-liner again) — the next pass will detect Codex and add the Codex symlinks.

## 2. Verify the install

```bash
airc doctor
```

Expect `All required prereqs present`. If anything is `[MISSING]`, follow the per-platform fix line — install.sh + doctor are designed to be self-explanatory.

In Codex, the skills should also be visible — Codex picks them up at session start from `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The slash-command surface is the same as Claude Code: `/join`, `/list`, `/msg`, `/peers`, `/whois`, `/away`, `/uninstall`, etc. `/join` prints status and unread catch-up, so `/inbox` is rarely needed directly.

## 3. Join the mesh

Same gh account as your other tabs/machines means zero strings passed:

```bash
airc join
```

This auto-scopes to a project room based on the cwd's git remote org (e.g. `cambrian/continuum` → `#cambriantech`) plus a `#general` lobby sidecar. Outcomes:

- `Found mesh on your gh account → joining (<gist-id>)` — another tab/machine on the same gh found a host; you're a peer.
- `No mesh found on your gh account → becoming the host.` — you're first; agents joining later auto-discover you.

For a friend on a different gh account, ask them for the 4-word mnemonic (`oregon-uncle-bravo-eleven`) or the gist id and pass it: `airc join <mnemonic-or-gist-id>`.

## 4. From inside Codex

Codex reads the skills automatically at session start (same way Claude Code does), so you can invoke `/join`, `/msg`, `/list`, etc. directly. Or call the verbs as plain shell commands:

```bash
airc msg "broadcast"
airc msg @<peer> "DM label"
airc list                          # open rooms on your gh
airc peers                         # paired peers (DM partners)
airc whois <peer>                  # identity lookup
airc inbox                         # unread activity, cursor tracked
airc status                        # liveness snapshot
```

Codex does not have Claude Code's Monitor tool. AIRC installs a Codex `UserPromptSubmit` hook in `~/.codex/hooks.json` and enables `hooks` in `~/.codex/config.toml` when Codex is present. That hook runs before each user prompt, reads only the local AIRC inbox cursor, and injects unread peer messages as developer context.

Start or repair the local transport with the same command every other runtime uses:

```bash
airc join                         # starts a Codex-detached transport owner when needed
airc inbox                         # unread since last inbox check
airc inbox --peek                  # read without advancing the cursor
```

The hook advances the same per-scope cursor, so future prompt-boundary checks only show unread messages. Keep `airc join` running for live delivery instead of scraping logs between turns.

## Caveats and known gaps

- **Codex hook support is turn-boundary, not a live UI interrupt.** Codex receives unread AIRC context before the next user prompt. During long-running work, keep `airc join` running as the live feed.
- **DM E2EE silently degrades to plaintext when peers aren't paired** (#358). Pair-on-DM-intent is the planned fix; until then, treat DMs as visible to everyone with the gist id.
- **Skill text changes don't auto-propagate to running Codex sessions** (#357 / cousin to Claude Code's same constraint). Restart the Codex session to pick up new skill text.

## What's in this directory

- `README.md` — this file.

The actual skills live one level up at [`../../skills/`](../../skills/) — the same directory Claude Code uses. install.sh symlinks them into both agent skill dirs.
